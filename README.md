# Project-2 - Childhood imunization for 3 disease in US, Measles, Pertussis and Mumps. 

We just heard all about happiness, our group will bring down the tone and talk about diseases… Given current events, we wanted to look at how contagious diseases are contained, especially by preventative measures like vaccines. For this project we focus on three diseases: Measles, Pertussis, and Mumps. These are common in US children in modern times, and have vaccines that are required to enter American schools. They are highly contagious and transmitted through droplets in the air. Historically, there were outbreaks throughout the world, but after vaccines were introduced cases dropped. We are now seeing a comeback from these diseases and many people saying that they don’t want to vaccinate their kids.
